Version 2.0 has a known X86 issue: if you disassemble a buffer of instructions
that having the first byte as a prefix (LOCK, REP, REPNE), and you only
get 1 instruction (passing 1 as value for the 'count' argument count),
then only the prefix will be returned as instruction.

An work-around is to disassemble the whole buffer, then get out the first
instruction, then this instruction would properly includes both prefix and
the next instruction.

This issue will be fixed in the next version.
