Issues to be solved in next versions


[Core]

- X86 cannot handle many tricks introduced by malware yet. If you find any such
  instruction sequence that Capstone disassembles wrongly or fails completely,
  please report. This would be the top priority of our project.

- More optimization for better performance.

- Support more operand details for Arm, Arm64, Mips & X86, especially focus on
  non-standard instructions.


[Bindings]

- OCaml & C# bindings are broken due to many API changes. This should be fixed ASAP.
